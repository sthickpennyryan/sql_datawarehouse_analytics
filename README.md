# sql_datawarehouse_analytics

EDA on already established Data warehouse 
Cleansing process can be seen at: https://github.com/sthickpennyryan/sql_data_warehouse_project

All project files as a result of this cleansing are contained within the Project files folder:
      Bronze files represent the original files, loading in information from source data and inserting and truncating into tables
      Silver represents the cleaning and standardising the raw data into accurate usable information
      Gold is business ready data - to be used for analysis and is what our exploratory data analysis has used
