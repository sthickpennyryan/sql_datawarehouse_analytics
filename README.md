# sql_datawarehouse_analytics

This projects builds upon a data warehouse build in a previous project.
With the process of creating the ware house including truncutate and insert as well as data cleaning,  can be seen at: https://github.com/sthickpennyryan/sql_data_warehouse_project

It involves:
      - EDA 
      - Advanced analytics
      - Report making


All project files as a result of this cleansing are contained within the Project files folder:
      Bronze files represent the original files, loading in information from source data and inserting and truncating into tables
      Silver represents the cleaning and standardising the raw data into accurate usable information
      Gold is business ready data - to be used for analysis and is what our exploratory data analysis has used

--- All files used will be found under 'Project files'

This repository is to add upon my previous data warehouse project and begin analysis with an exploratory data analysis
      - The EDA process can be found under 'EDA scripts'
      - Advanced analysis and reports can be found under 'further_analysis)
