/* 
=======================================
Customer Report
=======================================
Purpose: 
	- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
	1) Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
	2) Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups
	3) Aggregates customer-level metrics:
		- total orders
		- total sales
		- total quantity purchased
		- total products
		- lifespan (in months)
	4) Calculates valuable KPIS:
	- recency (months since last order)
	- average order value
	- average monthly spend
